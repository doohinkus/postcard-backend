## MERN Postcard Exchange App In Development
This is a MERN stack app for an international postcard exchange. Each month participating users will be paired. Registered users can upload images of their postcards to the postcard gallery.

This project uses Express to create a token authenticated API that will be consumed by a React driven frontend client.

## More to Come
This project is still in development.
